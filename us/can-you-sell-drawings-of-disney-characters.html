																	<strong>Can you sell drawings of disney characters</strong>. 
								
																	Some anime shows have begun limiting the amount of fan art you can bring. 
																	You can t make money off of those characters without incurring their legal wrath. 
																	Only 30 of your prints can feature copyrighted characters or they ve limited the amount of an item featuring fan art that you can sell i e. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The short answer is no because those characters are copyright protected images and disney owns the copyrights which means it has the exclusive right to sell those images.
