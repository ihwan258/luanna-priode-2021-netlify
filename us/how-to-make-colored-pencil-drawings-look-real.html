							<h1>How To Make Colored Pencil Drawings Look Real</h1>

	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">How to instantly make your drawing look more realistic colored pencil drawing realism is trying to imitate actual objects in art as accurately as possible. Burnishing or blending with pale ochre creates an aged or antique look for metallic surfaces. I recommend investing in some prismacolor soft cores as they are the smoothest butteriest pencils out there and they make getting a silky smooth finish way easier. <br>
