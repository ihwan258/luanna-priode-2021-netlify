																	<strong>How to preserve colored pencil drawings</strong>. 
								
																	Don t over spray your artwork. 
																	Place the drawing on top of a larger piece of glassine interleaving paper. 
																	Additionally if your drawing is in coloured pencil or coloured chalks the pigments that they contain may start to fade quickly in full sun. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This solution will be spread in spray. 
																	If you re not worried about damage other than fading you can spray it like artists spray charcoal drawings with hair spray or art supply store spray fixative. 
																	Both can receive a small amount of fungicide may be formaldehyde or if you prefer something natural clove oil.

																	It s just a cover that keeps the flakes from charcoal or graphite from falling away from the surface of the paper.

																	The glassine interleaving paper should be approximately an inch bigger than the drawing on each side. 
																	If the drawing was sketched with colored pencils a fixative will also intensify the colors and prevent fading. 
																	A fixative helps to preserve the image by holding the graphite more firmly to the paper to prevent smearing over time.

																	Apply a spray on fixative to the surface of the pencil drawing. 
																	Glassine is also acid free and made to protect artwork.
